Python Image Labeler


Wishlist: 

   * Add ability to resize rectangles.
   * Add ability to draw free hand for semantic segmentation?
   * Add ability to load model in Keras for bounding boxes suggestions.
   * Add ability to have script generate image

Bugs:
   * Bounding boxes move when trying to zoom inside bounding box.
   * Zooming into an image causes issues when moving on to the next image of different size.
