Wishlist: 

   * Add ability to switch to next image fast, while saving coordinates from last image.
   * Create new wx.Frame for "Image Segmentation", suggest bounding boxes, based on criteria.
   * Add command line interface to start labeler.py
   * Ability to resize rectangles
   * Ability to draw free hand for semantic segmentation?
