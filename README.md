Python Image Labeler


Wishlist: 

   * Add ability to switch to next image fast, while saving coordinates from last image.
   * Clean up image movements buttons and that panel in general, Maybe image icons?
   * Clean up grid buttons and that panel in general, maybe image icons?
   * Create new wx.Frame for "Image Segmentation", suggest bounding boxes, based on criteria.

Bugs:

   * There seems to be a small slowdown when the image tools are used.
