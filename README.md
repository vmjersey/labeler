Python Image Labeler


Wishlist: 

   * Add ability to switch to next image fast, while saving coordinates from last image.
   * Clean up grid buttons and that panel in general, maybe image icons?
   * Create new wx.Frame for "Image Segmentation", suggest bounding boxes, based on criteria.
   * Ability to read in labels and coordinates from a CSV file

Bugs:
   * Allow user to edit labels column
